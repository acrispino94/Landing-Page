        <h1>The Greatest Superhero of all Time</h1>
        <p>He is not the fastest, strongest, or most powerful. He has no actual powers, but he's still the richest and most feared of all. Superman wishes he was Bruce Wayne.</p>

        <h3>Top villains Batman has faced</h3>
        <img class="villain" src="../Landing-Page/Joker.jpeg" alt="The Clown Prince of Crime">
        <p>Joker, Batman's one, true archnemesis and foil. No one knows his origins or true identity. Some say he only came into existence because Batman exists.</p>
        <img class="villain" src="../Landing-Page/Bane.jpeg" alt="Sometimes a mexican luchador. Sometimes a brilliant assassin psychopath. Sometimes Poison Ivy's chauffeur.">
        <p>Bane, sick, roided out gym bro. Hella smart and broke Batman's back. Probably don't mess with him unless you're juiced to the gills too.</p>
        <img class="villain" src="../Landing-Page/Scarecrow.webp" alt="Weird psychiatrist who gets off on drugging people. Probably a frat lord in college.">
        <p>Scarecrow, the weird psychiatrist who gets off drugging people. Definitely was in one of those creepy frats in college. Don't take a drink that he tries to hand you.</p>
        <img class="villain" src="../Landing-Page/Two-Face.jpeg" alt="This might be a controversial opinion, but I enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones's interpretation in Batman Forever.">
        <p>Two Face, once the Gotham DA. Makes decisions by flipping a coin because he can't think for himself. Really self concious about his appearance after the accident.</p>
